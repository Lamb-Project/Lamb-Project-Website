Document ingestion # Inside your base click Markdown Ingest (currently the most stable method). Drag PDFs, DOCX or .md files. Keep Chunk size ≈ 2000 for long texts. Tip: You can also upload .ZIP files as long as they contain .pdf, .docx, .txt or .md.\nYou can query the knowledge base directly:\n7. Connect the base to your assistant # Go back to My Assistants and create an assistant. In the template look for the RAG section and choose the newly created base. Indicate how many chunks (k = 3 is usually enough). Test your assistant in OpenWebui. 8. Debug mode (optional but useful) # Clone the assistant, change the model to Bypass and activate Simple RAG to see the complete prompt that LAMB sends to the LLM.\n9.
