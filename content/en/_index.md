# Create AI assistants for education without writing code

**LAMB** is a web platform that allows you to **design, train and publish AI-based learning assistants** in a visual and intuitive way. It works as a "teaching chatbot builder" that combines language models (GPT-4, Mistral, local models) with your own educational materials.

**LAMB** is an open source project developed by Marc Alier and Juanan Pereira, professors and researchers at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC) and Universidad del País Vasco (UPV/EHU).

## What does LAMB do for you?

### 🎓 Specialized Subject Tutors
Design assistants that only respond about the subject you choose, always staying within the appropriate educational context.

### 📚 Intelligent Knowledge Ingestion
Upload documents (PDF, Word, Markdown) and LAMB processes them automatically, creating a semantic knowledge base that feeds the model through RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation).

### 🔍 Advanced Testing and Debugging
"Debug" mode that shows the complete prompt to understand exactly what is sent to the model, facilitating response optimization.

### 🎯 LTI Integration with Moodle
Publish the assistant as an external LTI tool and embed it in your Moodle in a couple of clicks.

### 🔒 Guaranteed Privacy
Students interact within LAMB; their data is not shared with external AI model providers.

## Who is LAMB for?

- **📖 Teachers and trainers** who need a virtual assistant focused on their specific curriculum
