# LAMB PROJECT ROADMAP

Last update 8/7/2025

## LAMB Main Project 

The main lamb project implements the Learning Assistant manager and Builder. It combines the LAMB frontend (svelte ) and Backend (Fastapi) on a single app. It requires a slightly modified of open-webui forked from the main project. And it can be connected to lamb-project lamb-kb-server. 


### Milestone Release 0.1 

**Objective** : Provide a codebase that a sysadmin can deploy.
**Owner** @granludo 

### Tasks
* Compile a semi-production ready codebase with a stable enough lamb + open-webui + lamb-kb-server 
* Write and test a comprehensive documentation (maybe a screencast of the install process)
* Create a docker-compose so the three pieces of lamb 0.1 can be launched on containers.
